## Fondamenti di Programmazione 1 - (Programming Fundamentals 1)
All the scripts I made for the "Fondamenti di Programmazione 1" (Programming 101) university course  - Academic Year 2020/2021

~~Since the course is proposing the same exercises for the current AY (2023/2024), I decided to give the files (.py and .pdf) neutral names (originally they had the same name given by the teachers on DomJudge), to prevent cheating attempts by freshman year students.~~
It's literally your choice at this point. Bear in mind that being first in DomJudge's leaderboard isn't going to get you any bonuses.
